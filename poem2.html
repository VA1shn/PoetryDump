                    <h2>Chaos</h2>
                    <p>The frantic thoughts <br>that get lost in translation,<br>
                        The crazy thoughts <br>that question my sanity,<br>
                        The happy thoughts <br>that have me smiling ear to ear,<br>
                        And the sad thoughts <br>that make me feel hollow yet heavy,<br><br>
                        
                        The anger that <br>dissipates as fast as it comes,<br>
                        And the regret that <br>i wish wasn't a fleeting memory,<br>
                        The emotions i always <br>wished i could do away with,<br>
                        They continue to <br>make me, shake me and break me.<br><br>
        
                        My anxiety is a bitch, <br>it leaves me scared and tired,<br>
                        And I still struggle <br>to keep my thoughts and emotions at bay,<br>
                        But I'll take this chaos <br>over the silence anyday,<br>
                        As I'm in love with this <br>imperfect version of me!<br></p>
