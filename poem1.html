                    <h2>The tree speaks</h2>
                    <p>
Once upon a time,<br>
everybody loved me.<br>
They thought I was God,<br>
And always respected me.<br>
Slowly, everyone started<br>
taking things from me;<br>
They took my shade and flowers,<br>
ate my fruits and filled their tummy.<br>
But still they did love me,<br>
they didn’t take everything.<br>
But somehow, times changed,<br>
And thought they were the king.<br>
The humans became greedy;<br>
They cut my wood to make things;<br>
They started killing my friends,<br>
When the fellows had only few rings.<br>
But still I feel happy;<br>
I am giving them a lot.<br>
I just hope they realize,<br>
What dangers they have brought.<br>
I don’t mind giving them my wood;<br>
I don’t mind being their cot;<br>
I just hope they realize,<br>
What dangers they have brought.<br></p>
