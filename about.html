            <p> I'm Vaishnavi buddharaju and I think poetry is really cool! I'm no poet, not even close. I just wanted to share some poems I wrote for fun! Writing has always helped me understand myself, express myself, and also experience feelings and thoughts via imagination. I write when I feel bored, and honestly I wrote a lot more poems than you can find here! It's just that they're not worthy of PoetryDump. Hoping to write better poems and add them to the list soon! <br><br><br>
            Yours Truly, <br><br>
