                    <p><br>TRIGGER WARNING: CONTAINS VIOLENCE <br><br><br><br>


                        you try to hide your shaky hands by clasping them behind your back.<br>
        you wear a cap to hide your face and blame it on the sun.<br>
        And every time you hear my name it's like you get a heart attack,<br>
        cause you're being too careful, and now that's no fun.<br><br>
        
        why are you so jumpy? it wasn't that loud of a sound. <br>
        why are you sweating so much? it's not that hot around. <br>
        when people ask you questions, you do know they don't know anything.<br>
        but deep inside it scares you that they're all speculating.<br><br>
        
        remember, you might've gotten away without any consequences. <br>
        but the truth will never stop clawing on your insides.<br>
        that's because I'll haunt all your memories from now on. <br>
        and I'll make sure you'll live terrified until you die.<br><br>
        
        it's not guilt that's eating you alive, it's my blood.<br>
        and I'll make sure you'll never forget the day you killed me twice. <br>
        once was when you hacked my skull with a hammer. <br>
        twice was when you killed the truth and spread all those lies.<br><br>
        
        you shed tears for me and hosted the grandest funeral.<br>
        but get dressed in black again, the fun's about to start.<br>
        just know that I don't lie under that fancy gravestone.<br>
        I'm dancing with your lifeline and singing in your heart.<br><br>
        
        a song so haunting you'd think it's of a siren.<br>
        a sound so choppy you'd think it was a rhyme.<br>
        but it's the song I'll sing until you reach your own grave.<br>
        a song for the killers, a reminder of a crime.<br><br>
                    </p>
