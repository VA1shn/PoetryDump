                    <h2>Clown</h2>
                    <p>Feeling like a clown, faking smiles and cracking jokes,<br>
                    Acting crazy and happy but really, I’m left with no hopes.<br>
                    All they see is something silly, all they see is someone funny,<br>
                    But I'm just so tired of crying, so now all I can do is joke.<br><br>
                    
                    I’m nothing but a clown, face bright and smile painted,<br>
                    Masked up as child’s play, but my innocence is tainted.<br>
                    To all the clowns who stumble and fall just for laughs,<br>
                    I hope you’ll be fine; I hope you don’t collapse.<br><br>
                    
                    In the grand scheme of things we made someone’s day better,<br>
                    But is a smile on their faces worth our pain? Maybe, maybe not.<br></p>
